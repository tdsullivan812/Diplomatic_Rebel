Aryanna AryannaHead: I feel like you aren’t even trying to see things my way
Aryanna AryannaHead: you only care about what you want for me, but don’t care if I have a social life. 
Mother MotherHead: I am your mother, and that means I will always want what is best for you. Whether you agree or not is not important to me.
Aryanna AryannaHead: This isn’t just about me agreeing. It’s about the fact that because you don’t have any Danish friends, you don’t think I should have any either.
Mother MotherHead: Watch your mouth! You are being very disrespectful.
