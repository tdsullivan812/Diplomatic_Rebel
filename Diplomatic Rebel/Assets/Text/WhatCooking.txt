Aryanna AryannaHead: What's that you're cooking?
Mother MotherHead: Borani banjan. There was eggplant in our fridge we needed to use up.
Aryanna AryannaHead: Mmm, that sounds good.
Mother MotherHead: You always did like your banjan - it was one of the first solid foods your father and I gave you.
Mother MotherHead: That very first time, you tried to grab the spoon from my hands!
Aryanna AryannaHead: Haha, well some things don't change I suppose.
