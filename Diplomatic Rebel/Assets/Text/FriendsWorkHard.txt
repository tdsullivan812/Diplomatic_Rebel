Aryanna: I can see why it's respected - I think that tutors do work very hard.
Aryanna: That's something I admire about my friends in general - they all seem to work hard on the things they care about.
Mother: That's wonderful - I hope they continue to be good influences.
Aryanna: Maybe we could have them over to dinner sometime?
Mother: Perhaps. That is something I will speak to your father about as well.
Aryanna: (That went well - maybe if I talk more about my friends, she'll feel better about the party too.)
