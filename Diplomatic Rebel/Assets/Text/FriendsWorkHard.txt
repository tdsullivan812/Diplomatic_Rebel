Aryanna AryannaHead: That's something I admire about my friends in general - they all seem to work hard on the things they care about.
Mother MotherHead: That's wonderful - I hope they continue to be good influences.
Aryanna AryannaHead: Maybe we could have them over to dinner sometime?
Mother MotherHead: Perhaps. That is something I will speak to your father about as well.
Aryanna AryannaHead: (That went well - maybe if I talk more about my friends, she'll feel better about the party too.)
