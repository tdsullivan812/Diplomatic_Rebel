Aryanna AryannaHead: Did I hear Bibi Jaan right when she said that she partied a lot when she was my age?
Mother MotherHead: Yes, but don’t be misled. Partying means something very different to her.
Aryanna AryannaHead: What do you mean?
Mother MotherHead: She partied in an Afghan way. Not like they party in Denmark.
Aryanna AryannaHead: I wouldn’t know the difference, seeing as I’ve never been to either kind.
Mother MotherHead: Even so, Bibi Jaan is not in a position to give advice on the matter.
