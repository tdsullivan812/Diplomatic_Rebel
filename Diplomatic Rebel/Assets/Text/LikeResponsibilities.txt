Aryanna AryannaHead: I actually like having responsibilities, sometimes. It makes me feel capable.
Mother MotherHead: That is all well. But responsibilities are not something you can take on and off like a coat.
Mother MotherHead: Even when you don't like it, you still have to do as is expected of you.
Aryanna AryannaHead: I know that.
Mother MotherHead: I believe you. But the best way to show you are willing to take on responsibility is to follow through even when it is unpleasant.
Aryanna AryannaHead: Is this about the party?
Mother MotherHead: I don't know. Is it?
Aryanna AryannaHead: (It seems like she doubts my commitment to my responsibilities - is there some way I can show her that I want to make choices that make her proud?)
