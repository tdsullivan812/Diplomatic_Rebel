Aryanna: Did you ever party as a teenager?
Mother: Well, as I've said already, "partying" meant something very different to me growing up.
Mother: Regardless, in my childhood, I did attend the sort of parties that were appropriate for a young woman- family celebrations, weddings, holidays and such.
Mother: But as I got older, things were changing politically in Afghanistan. The Soviets were withdrawing, and the Taliban started to rise not long after. 
Mother: Those special occasions to party became less frequent, and young women were especially pressured into staying out of the public eye.
Aryanna: I hadn't really thought about all that.
