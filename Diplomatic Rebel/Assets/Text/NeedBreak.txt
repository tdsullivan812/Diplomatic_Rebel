Aryanna: Even so, I need a break from responsibilities sometimes. 
Mother: That is fair - but even in rest, one must be diligent.
Aryanna: What?! What does that even mean?
Mother: What I am trying to say is that once you take a break from fulfilling responsibilities, it is hard to go back to doing them.
Aryanna: I know, I know. But the way you talk makes even rest sound like a chore.
Mother: Perhaps it is! I have some more actual chores you could do, if you would like to compare?
Aryanna: ...I'm still resting.
Mother: Mmhm.
