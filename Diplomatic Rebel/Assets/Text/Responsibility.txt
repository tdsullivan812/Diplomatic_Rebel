Aryanna: Do you feel like handling your responsibilities gets easier as you get older?
Mother: I wish I could say yes. But more accurately, I might say you become more capable as you get older.
Mother: And it's a good thing, because you get more and more responsibilities.
Aryanna: That's pretty disheartening.
Mother: Such is life.
