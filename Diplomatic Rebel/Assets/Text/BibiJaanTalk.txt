Aryanna: So how is Bibi Jaan doing?
Mother: She seems to be in good spirits, all things considered. Aside from her friend passing, she seem's like she's okay.
Mother: You know how it is, dear. When you get to her age you're lucky to have friends at all. And Bibi Jaan has been blessed with many friends in Afghanistan.
Aryanna: Is there a reason why she's so popular?
Mother: Well, she's always been rather gregarious, and when your grandfather passed, she started spending even more time with her friends.
