Aryanna AryannaHead: So how is Bibi Jaan doing?
Mother MotherHead: She seems to be in good spirits, all things considered. Aside from her friend passing, she seem's like she's okay.
Mother MotherHead: You know how it is, dear. When you get to her age you're lucky to have friends at all. And Bibi Jaan has been blessed with many friends in Afghanistan.
Aryanna AryannaHead: Is there a reason why she's so popular?
Mother MotherHead: Well, she's always been rather gregarious, and when your grandfather passed, she started spending even more time with her friends.
