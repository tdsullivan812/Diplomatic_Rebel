Aryanna: Do you think that we should visit Bibi Jaan? It seemed like she misses you a lot.
Mother: In a way, but for now I think it is better that we do not go.
Aryanna: Why not? Is it because of danger?
Mother: Not exactly. More so that it makes Bibi Jaan happy to know that we are safe here in Denmark.
Mother: You may not remember this, but when you were around 7 or 8, I was very insistent about wanting to visit her.
Mother: I even had flights booked. But for months, your Bibi Jaan fretted and told me she was unsure if the timing was good, if there would be unrest, and the like.
Mother: Eventually I understood that she was worrying herself sick, scared that if we came back we wouldn't leave, and get caught up in another political upheaval.
Mother: So I cancelled the tickets. For a while I kept suggesting visits, but I always got the same response from her. Now we don't even discuss the idea.
Aryanna: Wow. I didn't know any of that. How does that make you feel?
Mother: ...I do wish that she was able to see me visiting as a good thing.
Mother: But I know that ultimately it is her way of caring, and showing us that she supports and understands the choice to remain here in Denmark.
Aryanna: (I never really thought about how much my mother must miss her mother.)
Aryanna: (Perhaps I should make an effort to spend more time with her.)
