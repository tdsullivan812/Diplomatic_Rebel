Aryanna AryannaHead: Do you think that we should visit Bibi Jaan? It seemed like she misses you a lot.
Mother MotherHead: In a way, but for now I think it is better that we do not go.
Aryanna AryannaHead: Why not? Is it because of danger?
Mother MotherHead: Not exactly. More so that it makes Bibi Jaan happy to know that we are safe here in Denmark.
Mother MotherHead: You may not remember this, but when you were around 7 or 8, I was very insistent about wanting to visit her.
Mother MotherHead: I even had flights booked. But for months, your Bibi Jaan fretted and told me she was unsure if the timing was good, if there would be unrest, and the like.
Mother MotherHead: Eventually I understood that she was worrying herself sick, scared that if we came back we wouldn't leave, and get caught up in another political upheaval.
Mother MotherHead: So I cancelled the tickets. For a while I kept suggesting visits, but I always got the same response from her. Now we don't even discuss the idea.
Aryanna AryannaHead: Wow. I didn't know any of that. How does that make you feel?
Mother MotherHead: ...I do wish that she was able to see me visiting as a good thing.
Mother MotherHead: But I know that ultimately it is her way of caring, and showing us that she supports and understands the choice to remain here in Denmark.
Aryanna AryannaHead: (I never really thought about how much my mother must miss her mother.)
Aryanna AryannaHead: (Perhaps I should make an effort to spend more time with her.)
