Aryanna: How are the parties different?
Mother: it is usually not done that one parties with strangers. Especially for women. 
Aryanna: is that all?
Mother: That and the kind of activities- often there is an emphasis on traditions.
Aryanna: seems limiting to have to always be partying with the same people and doing the same traditions.
Mother: some might say that actually, family are the people whom you can be most free around.
Mother: with strangers, you have to worry about their expectations and standards of propriety, but around your trusted family you can relax.
Arayanna: I hadnâ€™t thought of it like that.
