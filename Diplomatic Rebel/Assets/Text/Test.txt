Aryanna: Oh yeah, I had a test today.
Mother: Ah yes! How did it go?
Aryanna: Decently well, I think. Everything that me, Soren, and Lilli studied showed up on the exam. But even so there were some questions I didn’t know. 
Mother: What was the test on?
Aryanna: The Danish Reformation. Basically how Denmark became Lutheran.
Mother: I didn’t even know there was a time when they weren’t! 
Aryanna: Yeah, it’s weird to think about.
