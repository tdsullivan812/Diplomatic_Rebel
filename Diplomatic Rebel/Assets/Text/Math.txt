Aryanna AryannaHead: Mathematics has probably been giving me the most trouble. 
Aryanna AryannaHead: I get good grades, but it doesn’t come naturally- I just get by on being very thorough.
Mother MotherHead: Being thorough is a very good thing for maths! It is all about following logical steps to their conclusion.
Mother MotherHead: You know, I was pretty good at maths when I was your age - my father would ask me to do figures for him sometimes.
Aryanna AryannaHead: Really? I didn’t know that. Did you ever do advanced math?
Mother MotherHead: …alas, no. I never had the chance to. Things became difficult when I was entering secondary school.
