Aryanna AryannaHead: I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said those things.
Aryanna AryannaHead: I let my emotions get the better of me. 
Mother MotherHead: Good. I forgive you. But mind that you be respectful going forward.
Mother MotherHead: you know, when I fought with Bibi Jaan growing up, she would always tell me that if I didn’t understand her decisions now, I would later.
Mother MotherHead: She was right, and now I am telling the same to you. 
Aryanna AryannaHead: So are you saying that you agree with all the choices Bibi Jaan made?
Mother MotherHead: …I am saying that I recognize now that she had wisdom I did not when I was younger.
