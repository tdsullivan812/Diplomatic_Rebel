Aryanna: that’s really thoughtful, mom. But you don’t need to worry about me.
Aryanna: I already work really hard at school. And I know I have lots of opportunities.
Aryanna: trying new things, like cooking or parties, isn’t going to change that. I still want to be a good daughter to you.
Mother: oh hush, my love. You will make your mother cry.
Aryanna: haha, it’s not that big of a deal.
Mother: Stop, do you know that every parent dreams about hearing their child say these things?
