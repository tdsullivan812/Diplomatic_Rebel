Aryanna AryannaHead: That’s really thoughtful, mom. But you don’t need to worry about me.
Aryanna AryannaHead: I already work really hard at school. And I know I have lots of opportunities.
Aryanna AryannaHead: Trying new things, like cooking or parties, isn’t going to change that. I still want to be a good daughter to you.
