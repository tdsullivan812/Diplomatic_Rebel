Aryanna: You know, I've been considering learning to cook. 
Mother: What do you mean? You already know the basics.
Aryanna: Yes, but I feel like I just know how to prepare food. I've never really tried making entire meals.
Aryanna: I was watching a cooking  program recently, and the way the host talked about the food made me see it in a whole new way.
Mother: How so?
Aryanna: That every meal you cook creates an experience for the people eating it, an experience that is only possible thanks to decades, centuries even, of people building on culinary tradition.
Mother: That's a very interesting way to look at it. I do agree food connects us to the past - I still think about my mother when I cook.
Mother: But I'm still not sure why you would want to put extra time into learning something that you already do anyway.
