Aryanna AryannaHead: I do like hanging out with my friends from school. Soren, Karla, Lilli, Josefine...
Mother MotherHead: oh, I remember her - I liked her, she was polite. 
Aryanna AryannaHead: we have lots of classes together, so we get lots of chances to talk. You wouldn’t know, but she’s very funny! 
Mother MotherHead: you mean she tells good jokes?
Aryanna AryannaHead: more like she draws great cartoons, like the kind you could see in the paper.
Mother MotherHead: Oh. That sounds unique.
Mother MotherHead: So all of these friends, they are Danish?
Aryanna AryannaHead: ...yes, those friends are all Danish. But they aren't like what you see on those TV shows. They're diligent and thoughtful.
Mother MotherHead: That is good to hear.
