Aryanna AryannaHead: Since I don't say it enough, I'll say it now: thanks, Mother. Not just for dinner tonight, but for everything.
Aryanna AryannaHead: I hadn't really even thought about how something as simple as cooking my meals was something you were doing to make life better. So, thank you.
Mother MotherHead: That's very good to hear now and then. I am just doing what I can as your mother - that wouldn't change even if you were the most ungrateful brat in the world. 
Mother MotherHead: Which, to be clear, you are not!
Aryanna AryannaHead: I'll try to keep that up.
