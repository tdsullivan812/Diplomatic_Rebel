Aryanna AryannaHead: I agree, their behavior is irresponsible. Those teenagers should be more careful.
Mother MotherHead: You're completely right, but I am even more upset with the adults making the show.
Mother MotherHead: They are the ones who encourage this lifestyle and make it seem acceptable.
Aryanna AryannaHead: Well, there's some truth to that. But I know firsthand that many teenagers are capable of making good choices.
Aryanna AryannaHead: Like my friends from school- they aren't involved in those sorts of risky behaviors.
Mother MotherHead: That is good to hear. 
Aryanna AryannaHead: (Mother seems relieved - perhaps if she learned more about my friends, she'd be less uncomfortable with the party.)
