Mother: You're completely right, but I am even more upset with the adults making the show.
Mother: They are the ones who encourage this lifestyle and make it seem acceptable.

Aryanna: Like my friends from school- they aren't involved in those sorts of risky behaviors.
Mother: That is good to hear. 
Aryanna: (Mother seems relieved - perhaps if she learned more about my friends, she'd be less uncomfortable with the party.)
