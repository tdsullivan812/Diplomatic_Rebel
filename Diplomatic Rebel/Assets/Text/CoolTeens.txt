Aryanna: I don't know, those teens seem cool to me. They've got lots of friends and adorable babies.
Mother: Aryanna, you should know better! There's nothing "cool" about their behavior.
Aryanna: You might not agree with their choices, but it doesn't mean they're bad for making them. It's not like they're hurting anyone.
Mother: I'm sure their own mothers would disagree. Any mother would be hurt to see their daughter with no education, no job, and no husband to help raise a child.
Aryanna: So you're saying that if these women had just gotten married first, then you'd be fine with it? Seems pretty arbitrary to me.
Mother: That is not what I said at all! I think you are trying to make me seem a close-minded person.
Aryanna: You said yourself you thought they were immoral. I wouldn't call that acceptance.
Mother: Do not back talk me like that! We are done discussing the matter. 
Mother: And do not expect to go to that party - not until you show me some better judgment.
Aryanna: (Oh no, I think I've made her angry...).
