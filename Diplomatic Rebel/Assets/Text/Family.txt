Aryanna AryannaHead: Do you ever miss the rest of our family?
Mother MotherHead: ...Very much so. Sometimes very badly.
Aryanna AryannaHead: Is that why you don't speak about them much.
Mother MotherHead: Partly, but that's not all.
Mother MotherHead: The duty between family members is much stronger than other kinds of bonds.
Mother MotherHead: It might be years since you see someone, but you know that when you do, they will still embrace you and care for you.
Mother MotherHead: I hope that one day you will have a chance to see this for yourself.
