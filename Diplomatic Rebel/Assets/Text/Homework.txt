Aryanna: I already did my homework for the day during my study period.
Mother: Excellent. And have you reviewed your answers?
Aryanna: No, not yet. I'll be sure to do so later tonight. 
Mother: Why not now?
Aryanna: It's good to wait a bit, to help me look at the assignment with new eyes.
Mother: Fair enough.
