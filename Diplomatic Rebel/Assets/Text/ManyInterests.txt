Aryanna: How could you not be? Food, music, dancing... isn't it incredible that these are things every person has done, and yet still find new ways to do so?
Mother: You have the soul of a poet, Aryanna. Perhaps you should take up writing!
Aryanna: I actually tried that once, but as soon as the first words came out I felt silly.
Mother: At least you recognize it - when I was a teenager I wrote some exceedingly silly poetry, and only realized it when I read it years later.
