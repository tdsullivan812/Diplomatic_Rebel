Aryanna AryannaHead: Can I ask why you don't like the idea of me going to the party?
Mother MotherHead: Well, your father and I really don't know what to expect from this kind of party.
Aryanna AryannaHead: "This kind" of party?
Mother MotherHead: To us, it isn't normal for a school to throw a party for its students.
Mother MotherHead: I've also heard some unsavory things about how Danish teenagers like to party...
Aryanna AryannaHead: Heard? Or watched TV dramas?
Mother MotherHead: All the same, while I'm sure most of the students are very nice, one can never be too careful.
