Aryanna: Why do you hate that show so much?
Mother: They glorify such immoral behaviors. Irresponsible drinking, pregnancy, infidelity. Half of the young mothers on that show don't even spend time with their baby!
Aryanna: If you hate those programs, why do you always have the reality television channel turned on when I come home?
Mother: ...That is beside the point! I will never understand that side of Danish culture.
Aryanna: It seems harsh to generalize Danish culture that way. There are really a small number whose lives reflect what you see on TV.
Mother: I've seen enough of those programs to know it's more than just one or two!
Aryanna: (So she admits she's been watching them...)
