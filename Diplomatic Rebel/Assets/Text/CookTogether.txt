Aryanna: You know, I kind of like cooking with you, Mom. Maybe we should do it more often?
Mother: I’m glad you like it, but… I prefer it if I do most of the cooking.
Aryanna: really? You do so much of it already, don’t you want some help?
Mother: …it’s complicated. In Afghanistan, there is a lot of pressure for women to become wives and cook for their husband.
Mother: One of the reasons we came to Denmark is so that you could live without that pressure.
Mother: That’s why I see it as my job to cook for you, and your job to focus on your studies, so that you can choose for yourself.
