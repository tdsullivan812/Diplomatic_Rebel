Aryanna AryannaHead: Sometimes I just get so bored of my life - 
Mother MotherHead: That is life, sweetie. You do boring things all day, every day.
Aryanna AryannaHead: Thanks, mom. Arenâ€™t you supposed to tell me that life is a precious gift and I should be more grateful?
Mother MotherHead: True, true. But you can be grateful and bored. 
Mother MotherHead: As you get older you will find the things to keep you occupied. Then it gets more tolerable. 
Mother MotherHead: Besides, you keep bragging to me about all the free time you have- maybe try to keep yourself entertained. Or maybe help me with some chores?
