Aryanna: Tell me the good things you remember from Afghanistan.
Mother: I can tell you a few things. As you know, it is where most of our family still lives.
Mother: It was not just parents and siblings too- we saw our cousins, aunts, uncles, and distant relatives almost as frequently.
Aryanna: That's so different than what I've grown up with...
Mother: Yes, it is one of the things we wish we could have provided for you.
Mother: Besides being close to the whole family, it's also a beautiful place. When I was growing up, there was this beautiful fig tree that grew behind our house...
Mother: I still have dreams of it sometimes. 
Aryanna: Thanks for sharing mom. I hope I get the chance to visit sometime.
Mother: Me too.
