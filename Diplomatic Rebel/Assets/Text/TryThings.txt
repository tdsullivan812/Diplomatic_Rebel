Aryanna: You know, I think it’s good to try new things. eating New foods, listening to new music, meeting new people.
Mother: I am glad you are so open-minded. But sometimes it’s good to rely on traditions too.
Aryanna: have you tried anything new recently, Mother?
Mother: I suppose I’ve started reading a new book. One of those action novels.
Mother: …or more accurately, I bought the book and it’s sitting on my nightstand. 
Aryanna: …maybe you could start with trying to let me go to the dance?
Mother: ha, you are clever.
