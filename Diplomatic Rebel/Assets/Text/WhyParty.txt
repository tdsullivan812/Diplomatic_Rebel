Aryanna AryannaHead: That's why I want to go to the school party so much.
Aryanna AryannaHead: There are so many things I still know so little about, including these kinds of social events.
Aryanna AryannaHead: But in order to learn more, I feel a pressure - to go to these kinds of things, because that's just what my friends expect of me.
Aryanna AryannaHead: But I know that you and dad also expect things of me, so I feel a pressure that way too.
Aryanna AryannaHead: It's not that these pressures are bad, but it's difficult to always be surrounded by them.
Aryanna AryannaHead: ...does this make sense to you.
Mother MotherHead: It really does. You articulated your feelings very eloquently.
Mother MotherHead: I am still unsure about this school party, but I can see that it seems important to you.
Mother MotherHead: When your father comes home, I will do my best to persuade him this is more than just a fleeting fancy for you.
