Aryanna AryannaHead: Though since I'm starting to get more free time, I've been debating how to use it.

Aryanna AryannaHead: An after-school activity or club seems like it could be fun, and a good way to meet people.

Aryanna AryannaHead: Yes, yes, I know it has to be a good use of my time.
Mother MotherHead: Of course, you are always welcome to do more chores around the house as well.
