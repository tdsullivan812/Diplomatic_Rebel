Aryanna: Though since I'm starting to get more free time, I've been debating how to use it.
Mother: What have you been considering?
Aryanna: An after-school activity or club seems like it could be fun, and a good way to meet people.
Mother: If you do that, you must select carefully - pick something that advances your future, not just a club with friends.
Aryanna: Yes, yes, I know it has to be a good use of my time.
Mother: Of course, you are always welcome to do more chores around the house as well.
