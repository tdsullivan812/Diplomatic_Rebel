Aryanna AryannaHead: Do you have a favorite Afghan dish?
Mother MotherHead: It is hard for me to pick! But probably mantu. 
Mother MotherHead: Sometimes, my sisters and I would have a contest to see who could make the best sauce for the dumplings, and then try them all.
Aryanna AryannaHead: That sounds fun! And delicious.
Mother MotherHead: Actually, it often ended with us secretly trying to sabotage each other's sauces, so they would all taste awful.
Aryanna AryannaHead: Oh.
Mother MotherHead: But it was fun. And we never sabotaged the mantu itself, which is why I still enjoy it so much.
